Example for 2D HMM
start state: only diagonal transition (optionally can be placed before any cell in a 2D data grid)
end state: empty state located alongside bottom and right borders of data grid (optionally can occur after any cell in a 2D grid with diagonal transition;
    end to end transition can be disallowed)
C_x(i,j) = {s(i,j-1)=x_i,j-1; s(i-1,j)=x_i-1,j; s(i-1,j-1)=x_i-1,j-1}
P(s(i,j)=x_i,j|C_x(i,j)) = s(i,j)_e * P(s(i,j-1)=x_i,j-1|C_x(i,j-1))*s(i,j-1)_t * P(s(i-1,j)=x_i,j-1|C_x(i-1,j))*s(i-1,j)_t * s(i-1,j-1)_t/P(s(i-1,j-1)=x_i-1,j-1|C_x(i-1,j-1))
fwd(s(i,j)) = SUM_X(P(s(i,j)=x_i,j|C_x(i,j)))
bwd(s(i,j)) analogous to fwd(s(i,j))
vit(s(i,j)) = max_X(P(s(i,j)=x_i,j|C_x(i,j)))
